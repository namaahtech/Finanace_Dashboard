// (the runtime failed with "Could not find Chrome ... /home/sbx_userXXXX/.cache/puppeteer").
//
// Fix: in serverless/production use `@sparticuz/chromium` (a Lambda-sized Chromium
// binary) driven by `puppeteer-core`; locally keep the full `puppeteer` with its
// bundled Chrome so dev needs no extra setup. Dynamic imports keep each path from
// pulling in the other's heavy dependency.
